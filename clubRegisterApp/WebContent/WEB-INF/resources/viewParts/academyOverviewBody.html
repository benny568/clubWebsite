							<strong>Information for You, The New Coach, Parents and helpers</strong>
 							<br/><br/>
							<p class="lead a-orange-text">Venue and Times</p>
							The Avenue Academy runs each season from September through to May, every Saturday morning, from 9.30AM - 10.30AM in the Lee's Road Astro Facility. 
							<br/><br/>
							<p class="lead a-orange-text">Academy Size</p>
							During our 2013/2014 Season the Academy had up to 120 U5's-U10's participating in these sessions. 
							 Such a large group requires a large number of coaches and helpers to organise each session, so we can provide the the best possible 
							 training and development to the kids.
							<br/> <br/>
							<p class="lead a-orange-text">Objective</p>
							The main objective of the Academy is to ensure the kids learn the Fundamentals of Soccer, while having FUN in the process.
							<br/><br/>
							<p class="lead a-orange-text">Getting Involved</p>
							If you're a parent or relation who attends these sessions, the Club would really welcome and do need your help if you're in any way 
							interested in getting involved. Whether that means providing encouragement, helping to set up or put away the equipment, supervision of 
							injured players/toilet breaks. This is a great way in which to help the youngsters as they begin their football development. Please do 
							come forward any Saturday, you can talk to any of the Head Coaches, or contact the Academy Director directly for more information.
							<br/><br/>
							<p class="lead a-orange-text">Becoming a Coach</p>
							If you're interested in the coaching aspect of things, you can work with the Academy Development Committee who will recommend and help you 
							on your coaching development pathway.
							<br/><br/>
							<p class="lead a-orange-text">During Games</p>
							Avenue United are strong supporters of the Silent Side-line initiative. We would ask that parents provide encouragement only, 
							not instruction, to all players on the pitch and desist from infringing on those areas that are rightly the domain of the team coach. Young 
							players, in particular, get confused when they are receiving multiple messages from the side-line.
